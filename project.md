# HOAI Project

Notes

## Goal

Evaluate some tools in an area of choice:

1. Gene expression/regulation
2. Epigenomics
3. Pharmacogenomics
4. Disease variants
5. Variant calling & annotation

on qantitative measurements (find some exercise in the given area and compare
the tools), but also qualitative measurements & usability (can I use it quickly
& easily or is it a pain to set up; does it run on my laptop or so I need huge
resources; ...)

## Additional resources
