# Glossary

## Abbreviations

NGS
: Next Generation Sequencing

scRNA-seq
: Single Cell RNA Sequencing

SNP
: Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (mutation/switch in one base pair)

LSTM
: long short-term memory

TFBS
: transcription factor binding site

VUC
: Variant of unkown clinical significance

WGS, WEG
: Whole genome/exome sequencing

GWAS
: Genome-wide association study

EPI
: Enhancer-promoter interaction, effects gene expression/regulation

## Terms

Gene
: Sequence of DNA that is transcribed into RNA

Exon
: Part of gene that makes it into final RNA

Intron
: Parts between exons that are removed in splicing

transfer RNA
: fulfills some purpose directly

messenger RNA (mRNA)
: encodes a protein

Splicing
: precursor messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) is transformed into mature m-RNA by
removing the Introns and leaving only Exons

Variant Calling
: Finding SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism), Insertions and Deletions in
Sequencing data

Methylation
: Process used to disable/enable genes

Epigenomics
: Studies heritable phenotypical changes that are not caused by changes to the
genotype directly but e.g. by methylation due to external factors
