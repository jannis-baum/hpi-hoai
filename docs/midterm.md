# Midterm presentation

1. Introduction: Short biological motivation of RNA Splice Site Prediction
   - What is it, why does it happen?
   - Why would we want to predict where it happens? Applications
2. Methods:
   - Introduce SpliceAI and Pangolin, compare
     - Inputs & Outputs
     - Architecture
     - Usability, (required resources & runtime)
     - (What was the model trained on?)
     - (What other parameters can we configure?)
   - Mention linear models
     - Why would we use linear vs. non-linear models?
     - Splicing vs Image Processing, why do similar methods work?
3. My contributions:
   - create a comparable metric from the models' outputs
   - evaluate the models on a new dataset that they weren't trained on
